# Game of Life

John Conway's game of life is a cellular automaton. The game consists of a grid that contains a number of squares. A square may or may not be occupied by a cell. The game is divided into generations that govern the distribution of cells in the grids. Its rules are very simple:
A dead cell with exactly 3 living neighbors becomes alive.
A cell with 2 or 3 living neighbors remains alive, otherwise it dies of isolation or overpopulation.

This project has been developed under python with the TKinter framework.
